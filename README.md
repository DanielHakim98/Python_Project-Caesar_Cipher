# Python_Project-Caesar_Cipher
* The project is similar to Caesar Cipher project in Ruby, but this time it is written in Python.
* As for practice for my training under Data Star, I create this project to understand how Python works differently from Ruby, Javascript, Java and C++.
* For this project, I've initally done some flowchart and pseudocode to understand the whole flow of the code.
* I also learn to use flowchart app called Diagram.net.

* It's been a long time since my last commit, the code file is added.
* I might not be able to commit actively for a while, I have other commitment with training for Data Engineer.
